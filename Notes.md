### Notes

#### 1. Print percentage

>>> print "{0:.0f}%".format(1/3 * 100)
33%

>>> print "{:.0%}".format(1/3)
33% 

#### 2. Escape dollar sign

- \$ : does not always work

- \\$: use '\\' if need to escape the dollar sign at the start of a line or in the parenthesis

#### 3. Italic

Sometimes both * and _ are not working, solutions pending...
